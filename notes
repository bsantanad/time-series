notes from, time series forecasting by Marco Peixeiro

intro
=====

time series: set of points oredered in time. usually equally spaced in time.

has 3 components:

- trend:
    the slow-moving changes in a time series. like trying to draw a line
    trhough most the data points to show the general direction of a time series

- seasonal component:
    cycle that occurs over a fixed period of time.

- residuals:
    what can not be explained by the trend or the seasonal components. we can
    think of it as, adding teh trend ans seasonal graphs together and comparing
    the value at each point

    usually corresponds to random errors, white noise and so on.

    they represent info the model can not predict since it is random.


visualizing these components is known as _decomposition_


brid's-eye view of time series forecasting
------------------------------------------

forecasting: predicting the future using historical data and knowledge of
future events that might affect our forecasts.


1. set a goal
2. determine what must be forecast to achieve our goal
3. set the horizon of the forecast (horizon: period you want to predict the
data on)
4. gather the data
5. *develop a forecasting model*
6. deploy to production
7. monitor
8. collect new data
9. repeat step 5


diff between time series forecasting and other regressions tasks
----------------------------------------------------------------

- time seres have an order
  - time sereis are indexed by time, order must be kept. on the other hand, say
    you want to predict revenue based on ad spend, it does not matter when
    certain amount was spent on ads.

-  time series do not have features
  - it is common to only have two columns, time and the data itself, it does
    not have categories and so on


baseline model
==============

a baseline model is a trivial solution to our problem. it uses heuristics or
simple statistics to generate predictons.

The baseline model is the simplest solution you can think of.

In the context of time series, simple static we can use to build baseline is
the arithmetic mean.

something like saying:

>>> the average EPS between 1960 and 1979 was $4.31. Therefore, I expect the
>>> EPS over the next four quarters of 1980 to be equal to $4.31 per quarter

other way is to naively forecast the last recorded data point.

>>> if the EPS is $0.71 for this quarter, then the EPS will aslo be $0.71 for
>>> next quarter

or if we see a cyclical pattern:

>> if the EPS is $14.04 for the first quarter of 1979, then the EPS for the
>> first quarter of 1980 will alaso be $14.04

when we define a baseline we need to calculate an error metric in order to
evaluate the perfomance of our forecasts on the test set

- mean absolute percentage error (MAPE):
    measure prediction accuracy, independent of the scale of our data
